r"""The Branin use case to benchmark and illustrate active learning algorithms.

The Branin function
$$f(x_1,x_2) =
\left(15x_2 - \frac{5.1}{4\pi^2}(15x_1-5)^2 + \frac{5}{\pi}(15x_1-5)-6\right)^2
+ \left(10- \frac{10}{8\pi}\right)\cos(15x_1-5)
+10$$
is commonly studied through the random variable $Y=f(X_1,X_2)$
where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent random variables
uniformly distributed over $[0,1]$.
