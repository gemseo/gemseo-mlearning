r"""The Rosenbrock use case to benchmark and illustrate active learning algorithms.

The Rosenbrock function $$f(x_1,x_2) = 100(x_2-x_1^2)^2 + (1-x_1)^2 $$ is commonly
studied through the random variable $Y=f(X_1,X_2)$ where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent
random variables uniformly distributed over $[-2,2]$.
