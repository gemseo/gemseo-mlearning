r"""Common expected improvement of the regression model.

This is the same as the expected improvement of the regression model for the minimum.

Statistics:

.. math::

   EI[x] = E[\max(y_{min}-Y(x),0)]

where :math:`y_{min}=\min_{1\leq i \leq n}~y^{(i)}`.

Bootstrap estimator:

.. math::

   \widehat{EI}[x] = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \max(f_{min}-Y_b(x),0)
