    r"""The expected improvement.

    This acquisition criterion is expressed as

    $$
    EI[x] =
    \mathbb{E}
    \left[\max\left((\kappa\mathbb{S}[Y(x)])^2 - (y_{\alpha} - Y(x))^2,0\right)\right]
    $$

    where $y_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-quantile of the model output
    and $Y$ is the random process
    modelling the uncertainty of the surrogate model $\hat{f}$.

    In the case of a Gaussian process regressor,
    it has an analytic expression:

    $$
    EI[x] = \mathbb{V}[Y(x)]
    \left(
    (\kappa^2-1-t^2)(\Phi(t^+)-\Phi(t^-))
    -2t(\phi(t^+)-\phi(t^-))
    +t^+\phi(t^+)
    -t^-\phi(t^-)
    \right)
    $$

    where $Y$ is the random process
    modelling the uncertainty of the surrogate model $\hat{f}$,
    $t=\frac{y_{\alpha} - \mathbb{E}[Y(x)]}{\mathbb{S}[Y(x)]}$,
    $t^+=t+\kappa$,
    $t^-=t-\kappa$
    and $\kappa>0$.

    For the acquisition of $q>1$ points at a time,
    the acquisition criterion changes to

    $$EI[x_1,\dots,x_q] = \mathbb{E}\left[\max_{1\leq i\leq q}\left(
    \max((\kappa\mathbb{S}[Y(x_i)])^2 - (y_{\alpha} - Y(x_i))^2,0)
    \right)\right]$$

    where the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of
    the random vector $(Y(x_1),\dots,Y(x_q))$.
    There is no analytic expression
    and the acquisition is thus instead evaluated with crude Monte-Carlo.
