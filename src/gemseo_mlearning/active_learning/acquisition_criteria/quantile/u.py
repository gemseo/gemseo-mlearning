    r"""The U-function.

    This acquisition criterion is expressed as

    $$U[x] = \frac{|y_{\alpha}-\mathbb{E}[Y(x)]|}{\mathbb{S}[Y(x)])}$$

    where $Y$ is the random process
    modelling the uncertainty of the surrogate model $\hat{f}$
    and $y_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-quantile of the model output.
    For numerical purposes,
    the expression effectively minimized corresponds to its square root.

    For the acquisition of $q>1$ points at a time,
    the acquisition criterion changes to

    $$U[x_1,\dots,x_q] = \mathbb{E}\left[\min_{1\leq i\leq q}\left(
    \left(\frac{y_{\alpha}-Y(x_i)}{\mathbb{S}[Y(x_i)]}\right)^2\right)\right]$$

    where the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of
    the random vector $(Y(x_1),\dots,Y(x_q))$.
    There is no analytic expression
    and the acquisition is thus instead evaluated with crude Monte-Carlo.
