    r"""The expected feasibility.

    This acquisition criterion is expressed as

    $$
    EF[x] = \mathbb{S}[Y(x)]\times
    (
    \kappa
    (\Phi(t^+)-\Phi(t^-))
    -t(2\Phi(t)-\Phi(t^+)-\Phi(t^-))
    -(2\phi(t)-\phi(t^+)-\phi(t^-))
    )
    $$

    where $Y$ is the random process
    modelling the uncertainty of the surrogate model $\hat{f}$,
    $t=\frac{y_{\alpha} - \mathbb{E}[Y(x)]}{\mathbb{S}[Y(x)]}$,
    $t^+=t+\kappa$,
    $t^-=t-\kappa$,
    $y_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-quantile of the model output
    and $\kappa>0$.

    For the acquisition of $q>1$ points at a time,
    the acquisition criterion changes to
    $$EF[x_1,\dots,x_q] = \mathbb{E}\left[\max\left(
    \max(\kappa\mathbb{S}[Y(x_1)] - |y_{\alpha} - Y(x_1)|,0),\dots,
    \max(\kappa\mathbb{S}[Y(x_q)] - |y_{\alpha} - Y(x_q)|,0)
    \right)\right]$$

    where the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of
    the random vector $(Y(x_1),\dots,Y(x_q))$.
    There is no analytic expression
    and the acquisition is thus instead evaluated with crude Monte-Carlo.
