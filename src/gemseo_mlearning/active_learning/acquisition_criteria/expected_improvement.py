r"""Criterion to be maximized for estimating a minimum, with exploration.

This is the same as the expected improvement of the regression model for the minimum.

Statistic:

$$EI[x] = \mathbb{E}[\max(y_{\text{min}}-Y(x),0)]$$

where $y_{\text{min}}=\min_{1\leq i \leq n}~y^{(i)}$.

Bootstrap estimator:

$$\widehat{EI}[x] = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \max(y_{\text{min}}-Y_b(x),0)$$
