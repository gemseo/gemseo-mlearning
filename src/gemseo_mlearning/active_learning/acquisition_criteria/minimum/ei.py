class EI(ExpectedImprovement, BaseMinimum):
    r"""Expected improvement.

    This acquisition criterion is expressed as

    $$EI[x] = \mathbb{E}[\max(y_{\text{min}}-Y(x),0)]$$

    where $Y$ is the random process
    modelling the uncertainty of the surrogate model $\hat{f}$
    and $y_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum output value in the learning set.

    In the case of a Gaussian process regressor,
    it has an analytic expression:

    $$
    EI[x] = (y_{\text{min}}-\mathbb{E}[Y(x)])\Phi(t)
    + \mathbb{S}[Y(x)]\phi(t)
    $$

    where $\Phi$ and $\phi$ are respectively
    the cumulative and probability density functions
    of the standard normal distribution
    and $t=\frac{y_{\text{min}}-\mathbb{E}[Y(x)]}{\mathbb{S}[Y(x)]}$.

    For the acquisition of $q>1$ points at a time,
    the acquisition criterion changes to

    $$EI[x_1,\dots,x_q] = \mathbb{E}\left[\max_{1\leq i\leq q}\left(
    \max(y_{\text{min}}-Y(x_i),0)\right)\right]$$

    where the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of
    the random vector $(Y(x_1),\dots,Y(x_q))$.
    There is no analytic expression
    and the acquisition is thus instead evaluated with crude Monte-Carlo.
