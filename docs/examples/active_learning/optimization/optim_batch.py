# The use of active learning methods
# dedicated to optimization
# is illustrated in this example.
# More specifically,
# we aim to test here
# the impact of batch acquisition,
# that is to say when several points
# are added at each method iteration,
# on the active learning procedure.
# The function to minimize is
# the Rosenbrock function $f(x_1,x_2)=(1-x_1)^2+100(x_2-x_1^2)^2$:
discipline = RosenbrockDiscipline()
# %%
# with $x_1$ and $x_2$ belonging to $[-2,2]^2$:
input_space = RosenbrockSpace()

# %%
# First,
# we create an initial training dataset using an optimal LHS including 10 samples:
learning_dataset = sample_disciplines(
    [discipline], input_space, "y", algo_name="OT_OPT_LHS", n_samples=10

# and two identical initial
# Gaussian process regressors from OpenTURNS:

# %%
# Then,
# we build two active learning algorithms
# to test the impact of batch acquisition,
# that is to say when several points
# are added at each method iteration,
# on the active learning procedure.
# We consider one algorithm with
# samples added one by one
# also called sequential acquisition (default),
# and in the second one,
# four samples instead of one
# are added at each iteration (parallel acquisition),
# using argument `batch_size` set to 4.
# Note that here,
# this feature is only available
# with the expected improvement criterion.
# All other settings are put to
# their default values.
