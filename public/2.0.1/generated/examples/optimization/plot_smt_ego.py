"""# Surrogate-based optimization using SMT.

The [surrogate modeling toolbox (SMT)](../../../user_guide/regression/smt.md)
is an open-source Python package for surrogate modeling,
with a focus on derivatives.
Bayesian optimization features are also available through its `EGO` class,
with various acquisition criteria and strategies to acquire points in parallel.

# In this example,
# we seek to minimize the Rosenbrock function $f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100(y-x^2)^2$
# over the design space $[-2,2]^2$.
# First,
# we instantiate the problem with $(0, 0)$ as initial guess:
problem = Rosenbrock()

# %%
# Then,
# we minimize the Rosenbrock function using:
#
# - the `"SMT_EGO"` algorithm,
# - a maximum number of evaluations equal to 40,
#   including the initial one at the center of the design space
#   (this first point is common to all optimization algorithms)
#   and the initial training dataset,
# - its default settings,
#   namely
#
#   - the expected improvement as acquisition criterion,
#   - 1 point acquired at a time,
#   - the Kriging-based surrogate model `"KRG"`,
#   - 10 initial training points based on a latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique,
#   - a multi-start local optimization of the acquisition criterion
#     from 50 start points with a limit of 20 iterations per local optimization.

# and note that most of the points have been added in the valley as expected:

# Lastly,
# we can compare the solution to the one obtained with COBYLA,
# which is another popular gradient-free optimization algorithm:
execute_algo(Rosenbrock(), algo_name="NLOPT_COBYLA", max_iter=40)
