"""# SMT's surrogate model.

The [surrogate modeling toolbox (SMT)](../../../user_guide/regression/smt.md)
is an open-source Python package for surrogate modeling,
with a focus on derivatives.
The [SMTRegressor][gemseo_mlearning.regression.smt_regressor.SMTRegressor] class
allows you to use any SMT's surrogate model in your GEMSEO processes,
including the gradient-enhanced surrogate models
as long as your training dataset includes both output and gradient samples
as explained at the end of [this page](../../../user_guide/regression/smt.md).

In this example,
we will approximate the Rosenbrock function[@molga2005test]

$$f(x,y) = (1-x)^2 + 100(y-x^2)^2$$

over the domain $[-2,2]^2$.
