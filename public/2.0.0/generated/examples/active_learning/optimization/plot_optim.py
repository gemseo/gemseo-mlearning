# The use of active learning methods
# dedicated to optimization
# is illustrated in this example,
# with all default settings.
# The function to minimize is
# the Rosenbrock function $f(x_1,x_2)=(1-x_1)^2+100(x_2-x_1^2)^2$:
discipline = RosenbrockDiscipline()
# %%
# with $x_1$ and $x_2$ belonging to $[-2,2]^2$:
input_space = RosenbrockSpace()

# %%
# First,
# we create an initial training dataset using an optimal LHS including 10 samples:
learning_dataset = sample_disciplines(
    [discipline], input_space, "y", algo_name="OT_OPT_LHS", n_samples=10
)

# %%
# and an initial Gaussian process regressor from OpenTURNS:
regressor = OTGaussianProcessRegressor(learning_dataset, trend="quadratic")

# %%
# Then,
# we look for 20 points that will help us
# to find the minimum.
# By default,
# for this purpose,
# the active learning algorithm looks
# for the point maximizing the expected improvement
# with the help of the SLSQP gradient-based algorithm
# applied in a multistart framework.

# the training points,
# the original model,
# the Gaussian process regressor
# and the expected improvement

# Finally,
