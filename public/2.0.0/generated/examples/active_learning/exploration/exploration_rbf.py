# The use of active learning methods
# dedicated to exploration
# is illustrated in this example,
# with all default settings.
# The function to approximate is
# the Rosenbrock function $f(x_1,x_2)=(1-x_1)^2+100(x_2-x_1^2)^2$:
discipline = RosenbrockDiscipline()
# %%
# with $x_1$ and $x_2$ belonging to $[-2,2]^2$:
input_space = RosenbrockSpace()

# %%
# First,
# we create an initial training dataset using an optimal LHS including 10 samples:
learning_dataset = sample_disciplines(
    [discipline], input_space, "y", algo_name="OT_OPT_LHS", n_samples=10
)

# %%
# and a universal regressor, namely a radial basis function network based on SciPy:
regressor = RBFRegressor(learning_dataset)
regressor_distribution = RegressorDistribution(regressor, bootstrap=False, size=50)
regressor_distribution.learn()

# %%
# Then,
# we look for 20 points that will help us
# to improve the overall accuracy
# of the surrogate model.
# By default,
# for this purpose,
# the active learning algorithm looks
# for the point maximizing
# the regressor local variance
# with the help of the SLSQP gradient-based algorithm
# applied in a multistart framework.

# Lastly,
# we plot the training points,
# the original model,
# the RBF regressor
# and the variance
# after the last acquisition:
